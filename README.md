# Overview

I decided to make Hangman, a project that I have done in the past with C# to learn Java. I decided to recreate this project because it helps me learn the basics that I need to be able to use the language while still having a simple concept of the program. I wrote a program that picks a random word given from the Words class, and updates the parachute man in the Parachute class whenever an error is given.
